An attempted completion and expansion of a technical test for a job interview.

I felt I did not present my best work with the timed technical test, and opted to take a bit of time afterwards to port it into my own environment, set up testing and finish up the work alongside some expansions on the idea. The assignment was to finish up a function to calculate an invoice, as simplified to returning an integer of cents based on information of a month-year, a subscription and a set of users.

To test this out yourself after cloning it:

```
npm i # to install dependencies.
npm t # to run the test suite.
```

Opted for Mocha as the test runner, as its recommended assertion library Chai was defined as used for the tests in the evaluation.

NOTE: Just in case I ever make this repo public, I have opted NOT to name the company this was for, so as to avoid this solution being used as an answer key for the assessment.
